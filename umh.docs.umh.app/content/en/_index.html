                        <strong>Yes</strong> - the United Manufacturing Hub is targeting specifically people and companies, who do not have the budget and/or knowledge to work on their own / develop everything from scratch.<br><br>
                        With our extensive documentation, guides and knowledge sections you can learn everything that you need.<br><br>
                        The United Manufacturing Hub abstracts these tools and technologies so that you can leverage all advantages, but still focus on what really matters: digitizing your production.<br><br>
                        With our commercial <strong>Management Console</strong> you can manage your entire IT / OT infrastructure and work with Grafana / Node-RED without the need to ever touch or understand Kubernetes, Docker, Firewalls, Networking or similar. <br><br>
                        Additionally, you can get <strong>support licenses</strong> providing unlimited support during development and maintenance of the system. Take a look at our <a href="https://www.umh.app">website</a> if you want to get more information on this.

                        We just want to buy something off-the-shelf (end-to-end solution or IoT platform). Why should we still consider the United Manufacturing Hub?

                        Because very often these solutions do not target the actual pains of an engineer: implementation and maintenance. And then companies struggle in rolling out IIoT as the projects take much longer and cost way more than originally proposed. <br><br>
                        In the United Manufacturing Hub, <strong>implementation and maintenance of the system are the first priority</strong>. We've had these pains too often ourselves and therefore incorporated and developed tools & technologies to avoid them.  <br><br>
                        For example, with <a href="/docs/core/sensorconnect/">sensorconnect</a> we can retrofit production machines where it is impossible at the moment to extract data. Or, with our modular architecture we can fit the security needs of all IT departments - 
                        from integration into a demilitarized zone to on-premise and private cloud. With Apache Kafka <a href="https://www.umh.app/post/tools-techniques-for-scalable-data-processing-in-industrial-iot">we solve the pain of corrupted or missing messages when scaling out the system</a>

                        There are three approaches:<br><br>
                        1. (beginner) <strong>use pre-existing services</strong> by just configuring them. 
                        You can, for example, create OEE dashboards for your entire shopfloor just by changing the central configuration file and "drag-and-dropping" a little bit in Grafana and Node-RED.
                        The services in the United Manufacturing Hub will take care of the rest.<br><br>
                        2. (intermediate, recommended for IT only) <strong>write your own microservices and deploy using our Helm Chart</strong>. If you want to create advanced applications, you can deploy your own microservices in the United Manufacturing Hub to interact with the data, e.g., deploy a machine learning algorithm or write your own dashboard. <br><br>
                        3. (expert, recommended for IT only) <strong>work with Kubernetes and our source code</strong>. If you have a good feeling about the United Manufacturing Hub, you can start adjusting the source code and the data model to incorporate entirely new applications. If you do that (and wish to contribute to the project), contact us before.
