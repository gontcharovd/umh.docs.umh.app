<!-- overview -->

Welcome to United Manufacturing Hub version 0.9.10! In this release, we have
changed the MQTT broker to HiveMQ and the Kafka console to RedPanda Console.
A new OPC UA server simulator has been added, along with a new API service to
connect to Factoryinsight from outside the cluster, especially tailored for
usage with Tulip. Grafana now comes with presintalled plugins and datasources,
and the datamodel supports grouping of custom tags.
