We are glad that you want to start setting up right away! This guide is divided into 5 steps: Installation, Managing the System,
Data Acquisition & Manipulation and Moving it to Production.


## 1. Installation using the Management Console

The first chapter explains how to install the United Manufacturing Hub (UMH) on your local machine using the UMH Management console. Currently, the management console only supports local installations, but in the future, it will also support edge device installations. If you prefer an open-source approach, there is also a tutorial for using k3d.

## 2. Managing the system

The second chapter teaches you how to use UMHLens to access and manage the microservices. You can also import a Node-RED and Grafana flow to see how the data flows through the stack. If you want to experiment on your own, you can move on to step 3, "Data Acquisition & Manipulation."

**2.1 Setting up UMHLens**

In this guide you will learn how to setup UMHLens and access all the microservices.

**2.2 Importing Node-RED & Grafana flows**

In this guide we will show you how to import flows into node-RED and grafana. So you will get an understanding how the data flows.

## 3. Data Acquisition & Manipulation

The third chapter guides you through the process of creating your own Node-RED flow using simulated data, and fetching it into the UMH data model.

## 4. Data Visualization

In the last chapter you can now visualize the processed data in Grafana. Follow the Guide
to learn how to log in to Grafana and then set up a simple dashboard.

We hope you managed to install the United Manufacturing Hub, process and visualize your data and will be able to apply that knowledge
to your specific setup in the future!

## 5. Moving to production

In the last chapter we will explain what it means to move the UMH to a production environment. It covers how to install external devices, use additional tools, and how you should navigate through our documentation.
