## Next steps

The next big step would of course be to use the UMH on an Edge device - you can find out how here.
However, if you want to try around locally, we recommend you try out these topics.

The OPC/UA-simualtor gives a good overview of how the OPC/UA protocol works and how to connect it to the UMH. You can find detailed instructions [here]().

The PackML Simulator is another simulator for getting started with PackML. Have a look at our [tutorial]().

If you want to create fancy Grafana dashboards, you can try Grafana-Canvas. In our last [blog article]() we discussed why Grafana_Canvas is a great addition to your standard Grafana dashboard. If you want to build one yourself, check out our [tutorial]().
