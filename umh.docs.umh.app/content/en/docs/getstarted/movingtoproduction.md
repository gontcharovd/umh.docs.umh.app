In the last chapter we will explain what it means to move the UMH to a production environment. It covers how to install external devices, use additional tools, and how you should navigate through our documentation.

The next steps to move the UMH into production would be the deployment on an edge device. You can click here to find out how to do that. 
If you want to tinker around locally we have some more simulators which are simulating Ot-Protocols like the OPCu-simulator or the PACK-ML simulator.
If you want to learn  more about our data-model you can visit the documentation of it.

Once you have UMH running on an edge device you could connect some sensors to it
