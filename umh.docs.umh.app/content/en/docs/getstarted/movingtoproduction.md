## Next steps

The next big step would of course be to use the UMH on an Edge device - you can find out how here.
However, if you want to try around locally, we recommend you try out the following topics.

### Grafana Canvas

If you want to create fancy Grafana dashboards, you can try Grafana-Canvas. In our last [blog article]() we discussed why Grafana_Canvas is a great addition to your standard Grafana dashboard. If you want to build one yourself, check out our [tutorial]().

### OPC/UA-Simulator

The OPC/UA-simulator gives a good overview of how the OPC/UA protocol works and how to connect it to the UMH. You can find detailed instructions [here](https://learn.umh.app/guides/getstarted/data-manipulation/creating-node-red-flow-with-simulated-opcua-data/).

### PackML-Simulator

The PackML Simulator is another simulator for getting started with PackML. Have a look at our [tutorial](https://learn.umh.app/guides/getstarted/data-manipulation/creating-a-node-red-flow-with-packml-data/).

### Kepware

Sometimes you need to connect different oldy ot protocol. KepwareServerEx is a great tool to bridge the gap between these old protocols and the UMH. Check out our tutorial on that and if you want to leran

### Edge device installation

Follow our [tutorial](https://learn.umh.app/guides/getstarted/installation/installation-guide-flatcar/) on how to install the UMH on an edge device using flatcar. We also made a blog article why we use [flatcar](https://www.umh.app/post/flatcar-as-the-operating-system-of-the-industrial-iot).
