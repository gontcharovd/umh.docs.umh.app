## Installation

The United Manufacturing Hub can be installed locally or on an edge device, depending on your needs. For simple tinkering and development, we recommend installing it locally using our Management Console. If you prefer an open-source approach, we also provide instructions for using k3d.


**Local installation using the Management Console (recommended)**

We have a very detailed documentation on how to install the management console and how to create your first local instance with it. click on the button below to find out.

**Local installation using k3d (may not be up to date)**
