  The United Manufacturing Hub can be installed locally, on your current 
  computer, or on an external device, for example an edge device or a VM.
  For your first installation or simple tinkering and development, we recommend installing it locally using
  our Management Console.

## Local installation using the Management Console (recommended)


  The Management Console is a client-side software, designed to assist you in 
  the installation, configuration, and maintenance of the United Manufacturing
  Hub (UMH) locally, on edge devices, virtual machines, on-premises servers, or
  in the cloud. Although the Management Console currently operates exclusively
  on Windows, it can facilitate the installation of UMH on a wide array of
  platforms, using Flatcar (a very basic and stable Linux version).
  To avoid any confusion, it's essential to understand that the 
  United Manufacturing Hub does not mandate Windows; this requirement
  only pertains to the Management Console, not the UMH itself.

  To access the documentation and download the Management Console,
  simply click on the button below.
