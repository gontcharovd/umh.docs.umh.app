The Network Monitoring feature of the United Manufacturing Hub visualizes the instances' network within the Unified Namespace. 


## When should I use it?
Your infrastructure might consist of multiple UMH instances. This feature offers a simple network view for monitoring the entire network of all instances, allowing you to detect any issues within the infrastructure. 

## What can I do with it?
The network view groups instances respecting ISA-95 schema. These groups are marked with dotted squares, and nodes are connected with solid lines. The current status of each instance is shown by colors as defined in the legend.
