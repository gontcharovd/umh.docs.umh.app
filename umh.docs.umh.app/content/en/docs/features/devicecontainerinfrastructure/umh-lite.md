If you are already using Unified Namespace, or have a Kafka / MQTT broker; and want to try out the basic UMH features, you can go for the UMH Lite installation.

If you want the full-featured UMH experience, we recommend you to install the Classic version. You can see a comparison of the features between the two versions below.
