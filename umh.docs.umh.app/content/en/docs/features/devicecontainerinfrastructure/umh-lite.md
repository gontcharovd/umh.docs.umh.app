If you are already using Unified Namespace, or have a Kafka / MQTT broker, you might want to try out the basic features of UMH. For this purpose, the UMH Lite installation is available.

If you want the full-featured UMH experience, we recommend installing the Classic version. This version provides a comprehensive suite of features, including analytics, data visualization, message brokers, alerting, and more. Below, you can see a comparison of the features between the two versions.
